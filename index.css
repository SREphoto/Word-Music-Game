/*
  All component-specific styles are now within their respective LitElement definitions in index.tsx.
  Global styles (like body background, font, dragging cursor) are inlined in index.html <style> tag
  to ensure they are applied early and correctly.
  This file is kept for potential future global CSS needs but is currently empty.
